# twitch-auth
 Client Credential Grant Flow for Twitch in Golang
 ___

## Creating a Library for Oauth2 authentication with the Twich API.

### Reason:
  I want to work with the Twitch API on various potential future projects that utilize
  Terminal User Interfaces. To make this easier, I want to create a modular library for
  managing my Oauth2 tokens with Twitch. 

### What This does.
Uses the [client-credentials](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth#oauth-client-credentials-flow) flow to retreive, verify, and refresh access tokens.
