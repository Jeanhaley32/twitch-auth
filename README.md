### What you'll need
You'll first need to [Register your app](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/).
This process should provide you with an `Application ID` and `Secret`.

You can then populate the fields of the TwitchAuth struct, and run the `NewTokenSet()` struct method to populate the token field with
a fresh token. 


### How this works:

Import the twitchauth library

```
import "github.com/jeanhaley32/twitchauth"
```

Create a TwitchAuth struct, and set the Client ID, and secret
```
	auth := twitchauth.TwitchAuth{
		ClientID: {clientID},
		Secret:   {Secret},
	}
```
Run the NewTokenSet method to obtain a new token. 
```
 auth.NewTokenSet()
```

`.Isexpired()` will return a bool showing if your token is expired.

`.TimeTillExpiration()` Returns a time.duration until you token expires.
